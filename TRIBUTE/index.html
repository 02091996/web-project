                    In 1978, he was appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (Indonesian: Menteri Negara Riset dan Teknologi,
                    Menristek). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other "strategic" industries in this post. By the 1980s,
                    IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie's
                    leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small
                    passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure. In developing
                    Indonesia's aviation industry, he adopted an approach called "Begin at the End and End at the Beginning". In this
                    method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the
                    planes was placed as the first objective.
                    By 1991, Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train-building, steel, arms, communications, and
                    energy.A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2 billion a year in state funding, although the
                    government's opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known.
                    
                    As minister, Habibie created the OFP (Overseas Fellowship Program), STMDP (Science Technology and Manpower Development
                    Program) and STAID (Science and Technology for Industrial Development). These three programs provided scholarships to
                    thousands of high school graduates to earn their bachelor's degrees in the STEM fields and for other technical
                    professionals to continue their study for master's and doctorate program in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other
                    countries.
                    
                    In Suharto's regime, as was expected of senior government executives, Habibie became a member of the Golkar
                    organisation. Suharto appointed him as deputy daily coordinator for the chairman of the executive board in 1992, and the
                    following year he became the daily coordinator.
                    
                    While serving in cabinet, Habibie was also elected as the first Chair of the Indonesian Association of Muslim
                    Intellectuals (ICMI) in 1990. This modernist Muslim organization provided him with a political base, linked to but
                    independent of the Suharto administration.

                <h2>Presidency of Indonesia 1998-1999</h2>
                <p>
                    Presidency 1998 - 1999
                    See also: Post-Suharto era § Presidency of Habibie 1998-1999
                    
                    Habibie taking his presidential oath on 21 May 1998.
                    On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the
                    Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet,
                    which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining others - with no
                    major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government
                    positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners.

                    Habibie was opposed to East Timorese independence but did offer East Timor special autonomy.[31]
                    
                    Timorese independence forces led by the National Council of Timorese Resistance had been calling for a referendum in the
                    territory for some time. Its chief diplomat, José Ramos-Horta, proposed a transitional period of autonomy leading up to
                    a referendum. In late 1998, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, sent a letter to Habibie suggesting that
                    Indonesia defuse the East Timorese issue by providing autonomy to be followed by the promise of a referendum in the long
                    run, following the method used by France to settle New Caledonian demands for independence. Wishing to avoid the
                    impression that Indonesia ruled East Timor as a colony, Habibie surprised some by announcing that a referendum, offering
                    a choice between special autonomy and independence, would be held immediately in East Timor. Leaders of the Indonesian
                    armed forces (ABRI) were not consulted on this decision.
                    
                    On 30 August 1999, the referendum was held and the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose independence. Subsequently,
                    pro-Indonesian militias killed and displaced large numbers of people during the 1999 East Timorese crisis. On 10
                    September, General Wiranto allegedly threatened to stage a military coup if Habibie allowed in peacekeeping forces,
                    causing Habibie to back down. On 12 September, however, Habibie accepted a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to halt
                    violence. A period of UN administration followed and East Timor became independent in May 2002.

                    Suharto's corruption charge
                    The MPR Special Session in November 1998 decried the presence of corruption in Indonesia, focusing particularly on
                    Suharto. In response to this, Habibie then appointed Andi Muhammad Ghalib as Attorney General. A tape of a
                    telephone conversation between Habibie and Ghalib was made public. It raised concerns about the veracity of the
                    investigation by suggesting that the interrogation of Suharto was intended only for public appearances.
                    
                    Under Habibie, the Indonesian government also began investigating and prosecuting Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala
                    Putra (commonly known as Tommy Suharto). Ghalib charged Tommy in December 1998 in conjunction with the Goro scandal,
                    where the government, under pressure from Tommy, allegedly gave him a desirable parcel and below-market loan for the
                    construction of a Goro supermarket. However, Tommy was found innocent in the case after several key witnesses, including
                    Habibie aide Rahardi Ramelan, changed their testimony and declared that the deal did not cause losses to the state.
                    
                    Habibie's government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few
                    months of Suharto's presidency. Habibie's government began to make conciliatory gestures towards Chinese-Indonesians
                    who, because of their elite status, were targeted in the riots of 1998. In September 1998, Habibie issued a
                    'Presidential Instruction' forbidding use of the terms pribumi and non-pribumi to differentiate indigenous and
                    non-indigenous Indonesians.
                    
                    In May 1999, Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous
                    requirement for a 'Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship' (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted
                    restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese.
