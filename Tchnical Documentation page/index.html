                Using Sphinx for kernel documentation
            </header>
            <p>
                The Linux kernel uses Sphinx to generate pretty documentation from reStructuredText files under Documentation. To build
                the documentation in HTML or PDF formats, use make htmldocs or make pdfdocs. The generated documentation is placed in
                Documentation/output.
                The reStructuredText files may contain directives to include structured documentation comments, or kernel-doc comments,
                from source files. Usually these are used to describe the functions and types and design of the code. The kernel-doc
                comments have some special structure and formatting, but beyond that they are also treated as reStructuredText.               
                Finally, there are thousands of plain text documentation files scattered around Documentation. Some of these will likely
                be converted to reStructuredText over time, but the bulk of them will remain in plain text.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="sphinx_install">
            <header>
                sphinx install
            </header>
            <p>
                The ReST markups currently used by the Documentation/ files are meant to be built with Sphinx version 1.7 or higher.               
                There's a script that checks for the Sphinx requirements. Please see <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Checking for Sphinx dependencies</a> for further
                details.               
                Most distributions are shipped with Sphinx, but its toolchain is fragile, and it is not uncommon that upgrading it or
                some other Python packages on your machine would cause the documentation build to break.
                A way to avoid that is to use a different version than the one shipped with your distributions. In order to do so, it is
                recommended to install Sphinx inside a virtual environment, using <span>virtualenv-3</span> or <span>virtualenv</span>, depending on how your
                distribution packaged Python 3.
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="note">
        Note:      
            It is recommended to use the 
            RTD theme html output.
            Depending on the Sphversion, 
            it should be installed
            separately, with 
            pip instsphinx_rtd_theme.
</code>
</pre>
            <p>In summary, if you want to install Sphinx version 2.4.4, you should do:</p>
            <pre>
            <code class="code">
        $ virtualenv sphinx_2.4.4
        $ . sphinx_2.4.4/bin/activate
        (sphinx_2.4.4) $ pip install -r 
        Documentationsphinx/requirements.txt
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>After running . sphinx_2.4.4/bin/activate, the prompt will change, in order to indicate that you're using the new
            environment. If you open a new shell, you need to rerun this command to enter again at the virtual environment before
            building the documentation.</p>

            <header>
               image output
            </header>
            <p>The kernel documentation build system contains an extension that handles images on both GraphViz and SVG formats.</p><br>
            <p>For it to work, you need to install both GraphViz and ImageMagick packages. If those packages are not installed, the
            build system will still build the documentation, but won't include any images at the output.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="sphinx_build">
            <header>
                sphinx build
            </header>
                <p>The usual way to generate the documentation is to run make htmldocs or make pdfdocs. There are also other formats
                available: see the documentation section of make help. The generated documentation is placed in format-specific
                subdirectories under Documentation/output</p>
                <p>To generate documentation, Sphinx (sphinx-build) must obviously be installed. For PDF output you'll also need XeLaTeX
                and convert(1) from ImageMagick <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org" target="_blank">(https://www.imagemagick.org)</a>.1 All of these are widely available and packaged in
                distributions.
                To pass extra options to Sphinx, you can use the SPHINXOPTS make variable. For example, use make SPHINXOPTS=-v htmldocs
                to get more verbose output.
                It is also possible to pass an extra DOCS_CSS overlay file, in order to customize the html layout, by using the DOCS_CSS
                make variable.</p>
                <p>By default, the "Alabaster" theme is used to build the HTML documentation; this theme is bundled with Sphinx and need
                not be installed separately. The Sphinx theme can be overridden by using the DOCS_THEME make variable.
                There is another make variable SPHINXDIRS, which is useful when test building a subset of documentation. For example,
                you can build documents under Documentation/doc-guide by running make SPHINXDIRS=doc-guide htmldocs. The documentation
                section of make help will show you the list of subdirectories you can specify.</p>
                <p>To remove the generated documentation, run make cleandocs.</p>

                writing documentation
            </header>
            <p>Adding new documentation can be as simple as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add a new .rst file somewhere under Documentation.</li>
                <li>Refer to it from the Sphinx main TOC tree in Documentation/index.rst.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is usually good enough for simple documentation (like the one you're reading right now), but for larger documents
            it may be advisable to create a subdirectory (or use an existing one). For example, the graphics subsystem documentation
            is under Documentation/gpu, split to several .rst files, and has a separate index.rst (with a toctree of its own)
            referenced from the main index.</p>
            <p>
            See the documentation for Sphinx and reStructuredText on what you can do with them. In particular, the Sphinx
            reStructuredText Primer is a good place to get started with reStructuredText. There are also some Sphinx specific markup
            constructs.

                Specific guidelines for the kernel documentation
            </header>
                <p>Here are some specific guidelines for the kernel documentation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please don't go overboard with reStructuredText markup. Keep it simple. For the most part the documentation should be
                    plain text with just enough consistency in formatting that it can be converted to other formats.</li>
                    <li>Please keep the formatting changes minimal when converting existing documentation to reStructuredText.</li>
                    <li>Also update the content, not just the formatting, when converting documentation.
</li>
                    <li>Please stick to this order of heading adornments:
                        <ol>
                            <li>= with overline for document title</li>
                            <li>= for chapters</li>
                            <li>- for sections</li>
                            <li>~ for subsections</li>
                        </ol>
                        Although RST doesn't mandate a specific order ("Rather than imposing a fixed number and order of section title adornment
                        styles, the order enforced will be the order as encountered."), having the higher levels the same overall makes it
                        easier to follow the documents.
                    </li>
                    <li>For inserting fixed width text blocks (for code examples, use case examples, etc.), use :: for anything that doesn't
                    really benefit from syntax highlighting, especially short snippets. Use .. code-block:: <language> for longer code
                        blocks that benefit from highlighting. For a short snippet of code embedded in the text, use ``.</li>
                </ul>

                    the c domain
            </header>
            <p>The Sphinx C Domain (name c) is suited for documentation of C API. E.g. a function prototype:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        .. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request )
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The C domain of the kernel-doc has some additional features. E.g. you can rename the reference name of a function with a
            common name like open or ioctl:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        .. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request )
            :name: VIDIOC_LOG_STATUS
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The func-name (e.g. ioctl) remains in the output but the ref-name changed from ioctl to VIDIOC_LOG_STATUS. The index
            entry for this function is also changed to VIDIOC_LOG_STATUS.
            
            Please note that there is no need to use c:func: to generate cross references to function documentation. Due to some
            Sphinx extension magic, the documentation build system will automatically turn a reference to function() into a cross
            reference if an index entry for the given function name exists. If you see c:func: use in a kernel document, please feel
            free to remove it.</p>
